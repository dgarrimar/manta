\title{Algorithm AS 204}
\usage{
AS204(
  c,
  lambda,
  mult = rep(1, length(lambda)),
  delta = rep(0, length(lambda)),
  maxit = 1e+05,
  eps = 1e-14,
  mode = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{value point at which distribution is to be evaluated.}

\item{lambda}{the weights \eqn{\lambda_j}.}

\item{mult}{the multiplicities \eqn{m_j}.}

\item{delta}{the non-centrality parameters \eqn{\delta^2_j}.}

\item{maxit}{the maximum number of terms \eqn{K} (see Details).}

\item{eps}{the desired level of accuracy.}

\item{mode}{if "\code{mode}" > 0 then \eqn{\beta=mode\lambda_{min}},
otherwise \eqn{\beta=2/(1/\lambda_{min}+1/\lambda_{max})}.}
}
\value{
The function returns the probability \eqn{P[X > c] = 1 - P[X < c]} 
if the AS 204 fault indicator is 0 (see Note below), and \code{NULL} if 
the fault indicator is 4, 5 or 9, as the corresponding faults can be
corrected by increasing "\code{eps}". Other faults raise an error.
}
\description{
Distribution of a positive linear combination of \eqn{\chi^2} random variables.
}
\details{
Algorithm AS 204 evaluates the expression
\deqn{
P [X < c] = P [ \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j \chi^2(m_j, \delta^2_j) < c ]
}
where \eqn{\lambda_j} and \eqn{c} are positive constants and 
\eqn{\chi^2(m_j, \delta^2_j)} represents an independent \eqn{\chi^2} 
random variable with \eqn{m_j} degrees of freedom and non-centrality
parameter \eqn{\delta^2_j}. This can be approximated by the truncated series 
\deqn{
\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} a_k P [\chi^2(m+2k) < c/\beta]
} 
where \eqn{m = \sum_{j=1}^n m_j} and \eqn{\beta} is an arbitrary constant 
(as given by argument "mode"). 

The \code{C++} implementation of algorithm AS 204 used here is identical 
to the one employed by the \code{\link[CompQuadForm]{farebrother}} method
in the \code{CompQuadForm} package, with minor modifications.
}
\note{
The algorithm AS 204 defines the following fault indicators:
\strong{-j)} one or more of the constraints \eqn{\lambda_j > 0}, 
\eqn{m_j > 0} and \eqn{\delta^2_j \ge 0} is not satisfied.
\strong{1)} non-fatal underflow of \eqn{a_0}.
\strong{2)} one or more of the constraints \eqn{n > 0}, 
\eqn{c > 0}, \eqn{maxit > 0} and \eqn{eps > 0} is not satisfied.
\strong{3)} the current estimate of the probability is < -1.
\strong{4)} the required accuracy could not be obtained in \eqn{maxit} iterations.
\strong{5)} the value returned by the procedure does not satisfy 
\eqn{0 \le P [X < c] \le 1}.
\strong{6)} the density of the linear form is negative.
\strong{9)} faults 4 and 5.
\strong{10)} faults 4 and 6. 
\strong{0)} otherwise.
